- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpecificIgE
- 👀 I’m interested in methodological considerations like dose reconstruction, identification of confounders, uncertainties in exposure and outcome measurement, and dealing with potential selection effects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about public health, quality of life, skin diseases, asthma, allergy, sensitivities & intolerances.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on these topics. Especially if the topics are explored in a work-related context.
